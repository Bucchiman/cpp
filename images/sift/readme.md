# Scale Invariant Feature Transform

## algorithm
1. Scale-space peak selection: Potential location for finding features.
2. Keypoint Localization     : Accurately locating the feature keypoints.
3. Orientation Assignment    : Assigning orientation to keypoints.
4. Keypoint descriptor       : Describing the keypoints as a high dimensional vector.
5. Keypoint Matching


## 1. Scale-space peak selection
